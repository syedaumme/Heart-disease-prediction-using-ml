# Heart-Disease-Predictor
### Prediction of Heart Disease using Machine Learning
The project aims to develop a machine learning model for heart disease prediction using a dataset containing health-related attributes. It involves data preprocessing, class balancing, model selection (Random Forest Classifier), hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The result is a user-friendly predictive system that can assess an individual's likelihood of having heart disease based on their health data, providing valuable insights for healthcare decision-making.
